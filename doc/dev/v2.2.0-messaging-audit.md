# In-Extension Messaging Audit — v2.2.0 Copy Plan

**Audited:** 2026-02-17
**Scope:** `apps/extension/src/popup.tsx`, `apps/extension/src/components/TokenCounter.tsx`
**Target release:** v2.2.0 (single submission, all changes bundled)

---

## Executive Summary

49 user-facing strings identified across the extension. The audit reveals **4 structural gaps** and **several weak copy instances** that undermine conversion and clarity. All changes are bundled into a single v2.2.0 submission to minimize review cycles.

---

## Structural Gaps (Missing Features)

These do not exist anywhere in the codebase and must be added.

### GAP-1: No Lifecycle Nudges

**Problem:** Every premium theme click from a non-subscriber shows the same message ("Subscribe to unlock premium themes!") and immediately opens the pricing page. There is no counter, no escalation, no variation.

**Impact:** Second and third attempts from curious users get the same abrupt redirect — a wasted conversion moment.

**Proposed solution:**
- Track premium theme click count in `chrome.storage.local` (key: `premiumClickCount`)
- On **1st click**: Show soft in-popup teaser (no redirect)
- On **2nd click**: Show stronger CTA + open pricing page
- On **3+ clicks**: Show "You keep coming back to premium themes" copy + open pricing page

### GAP-2: No Review Ask

**Problem:** No logic anywhere asks users to leave a Chrome Web Store review. This is called out explicitly in Phase 2, Weeks 3-4 of the roadmap.

**Impact:** Missing entirely. Organic reviews are the highest-trust signal on the CWS listing.

**Proposed solution:**
- Track successful theme applications in `chrome.storage.local` (key: `themeApplyCount`)
- After **3rd successful theme application**, show a one-time dismissible prompt:
  > "Loving ThemeGPT? A quick review helps others find it. ⭐"
  > [Leave a review] [Maybe later]
- Never show again once dismissed or actioned (key: `reviewAskDismissed`)

### GAP-3: Trialing State Not Handled

**Problem:** The API returns `planType: 'trialing'` but the popup never renders distinct copy for trialing users. They see "Premium" and an active badge — identical to a paid user.

**Impact:** Trial users don't know they're on a trial, reducing urgency to convert before expiry.

**Proposed solution:**
- Add `'trialing'` branch to the header button: show `"Trial"` instead of `"Premium"`
- Add a `"Trial Active"` badge (amber/yellow color) in the account panel
- If `trialEndsAt` is available from the API, show `"X days left"` in the account panel

### GAP-4: Canceled / Past-Due States Not Handled

**Problem:** `SubscriptionStatus` type includes `'canceled'`, `'past_due'`, `'incomplete'` — but the popup only checks `isActive: boolean`. Canceled and past-due users see the same UI as a never-subscribed user with no explanation.

**Impact:** Churned users don't know what happened and have no obvious path to reactivate.

**Proposed solution:**
- Add a `subscriptionStatus` field to the status response read by the popup
- Show distinct copy for `'canceled'`: `"Your subscription has ended. Reactivate to restore access."`
- Show distinct copy for `'past_due'`: `"Payment failed — update your billing details to restore access."`
- Both should link to `themegpt.ai/account` rather than the pricing page

## Weak Copy — Proposed Rewrites

These strings exist but should be improved.

### C04 — Upgrade CTA (non-subscriber clicks locked theme)

| | Copy |
|---|---|
| **Current** | `Subscribe to unlock premium themes!` |
| **Proposed** | `This is a premium theme — start your free 30-day trial.` |

**Rationale:** Current copy leads with "Subscribe" (cost framing). Proposed leads with the trial (risk-free framing).

### C20 — Subscribe button in account panel

| | Copy |
|---|---|
| **Current** | `Subscribe` |
| **Proposed** | `Start free 30-day trial` |

**Rationale:** Same principle — "subscribe" implies immediate cost. "Free trial" removes friction.

### C22 — Account panel description (not connected)

| | Copy |
|---|---|
| **Current** | `Sign in to access your premium themes and subscription.` |
| **Proposed** | `Sign in to unlock 8 animated premium themes.` |

**Rationale:** Specific and benefit-led. "8 animated premium themes" is more compelling than the generic "your premium themes."

### C09 — Header button (not connected)

| | Copy |
|---|---|
| **Current** | `Connect` |
| **Proposed** | `Sign In` |

**Rationale:** "Connect" is ambiguous and technical. "Sign In" is the universal web convention users recognize.

### C05 — Credits exhausted error

| | Copy |
|---|---|
| **Current** | `No downloads remaining this period. Manage your account at themegpt.ai` |
| **Proposed** | `You've used all your theme downloads this period. Manage at themegpt.ai/account` |

**Rationale:** Slightly warmer tone; direct URL to account page rather than homepage.

### C43 — Token counter privacy note

| | Copy |
|---|---|
| **Current** | `Estimated count. No data leaves your browser.` |
| **Proposed** | `Estimated · No data leaves your browser` |

**Rationale:** Uses a separator dot instead of a period mid-sentence, which reads more cleanly at small size.

## Copy That Is Fine As-Is

The following strings are clear, correct, and don't need changes:

- C03 `Apply {theme.name} theme` — clear aria-label
- C08 `Connection error. Please try again.` — clear error message
- C15 `Disconnect` — correct
- C23 `Connect with Google/GitHub` — accurate, no ambiguity
- C25 `or paste token` — fine as a divider
- C27 `Go` — acceptable for a compact token submit button
- C29 `Invalid token. Please try again.` — clear
- C30 `Account Connected ✅` — good
- C34 `Session expired. Please reconnect.` — clear
- C35 `Free Collection` / C36 `Premium Collection` — on-brand
- C37–C44 Token counter strings — no issues
- C49 Extension description — acceptable (though could be reviewed separately for CWS listing)

## Implementation Scope for v2.2.0

### New logic required

| Item | File | Complexity |
|------|------|------------|
| Premium click counter + escalation | `popup.tsx` | Low — `chrome.storage.local` read/write, conditional copy |
| Review ask after 3 applies | `popup.tsx` | Low — counter + dismissible banner component |
| Trialing state display | `popup.tsx` | Low — add branch to existing status logic |
| Canceled/past-due state display | `popup.tsx` | Low — add branch; requires API to return `subscriptionStatus` |

### Copy-only changes (no logic)

C04, C09, C20, C22, C05, C43 — all in existing render paths, no structural changes.

### Estimated total scope

~80-120 lines of new/modified code in `popup.tsx`. Well within the 200-line complexity gate.

---

## Files to Modify

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `apps/extension/src/popup.tsx` | All copy rewrites + lifecycle nudge + review ask + trialing/canceled states |
| `apps/extension/src/components/TokenCounter.tsx` | C43 copy tweak only |
| `apps/web/app/api/extension/status/route.ts` | Add `subscriptionStatus` field to response (needed for GAP-4) |

---

## What Stays Out of v2.2.0

To keep scope tight:
- No onboarding/first-run screen (separate future feature)
- No loading skeleton for theme grid (separate UI polish task)
- No `Paste token...` / `Go` button redesign (functional, not broken)
- No extension description copy changes (those require a separate CWS store listing update)
