# OpenAI Agents SDK - Examples

## Overview

The Examples section provides sample implementations of the OpenAI Agents SDK, organized into multiple categories demonstrating different patterns and capabilities.

## Example Categories

### Agent Patterns
"Examples in this category illustrate common agent design patterns, such as deterministic workflows, agents as tools, parallel agent execution, conditional tool usage, input/output guardrails, LLM as a judge, routing, and streaming guardrails."

### Basic
"These examples showcase foundational capabilities of the SDK, such as hello world examples, agent lifecycle management, dynamic system prompts, streaming outputs, prompt templates, file handling, usage tracking, non-strict output types, and previous response ID usage."

### Customer Service
Example customer service system implementation for an airline.

### Financial Research Agent
A research agent demonstrating structured workflows with tools for financial data analysis.

### Handoffs
"See practical examples of agent handoffs with message filtering."

### Hosted MCP
Examples showing hosted MCP (Model Context Protocol) connectors and approvals.

### MCP
"Learn how to build agents with MCP (Model Context Protocol), including filesystem examples, git examples, MCP prompt server examples, SSE examples, and streamable HTTP examples."

### Memory
Various memory implementations including SQLite, Redis, SQLAlchemy, encrypted sessions, and OpenAI session storage.

### Model Providers
Integration examples for non-OpenAI models and custom providers via LiteLLM.

### Realtime
"Examples showing how to build real-time experiences using the SDK, including web applications, command-line interfaces, and Twilio integration."

### Reasoning Content
Examples working with reasoning content and structured outputs.

### Research Bot
A deep research clone demonstrating complex multi-agent research workflows.

### Tools
OAI hosted tools including web search, file search, code interpreter, computer use, and image generation.

### Voice
Voice agent examples using TTS and STT models with streaming capabilities.
