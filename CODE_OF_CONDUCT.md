# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Our Standards

We expect all participants to treat others with respect, empathy, and professionalism. Constructive feedback is welcome; harassment, discrimination, and disruptive behavior are not.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please contact [security@themegpt.app](mailto:security@themegpt.app). All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled confidentially.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces — GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channel associated with ThemeGPT.
